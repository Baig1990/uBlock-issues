### Prerequisites

<!-- To rule out invalid issues, confirm and check each one of the checkboxes. Not doing so may result in the issue being closed as invalid with no further comment -->
<!-- Speculated performance issues will be marked as invalid and closed if they do not come with actual profiling data + analysis supporting the claim -->
<!-- Opening issues for adding new filter lists is now disallowed and such issues will be declined and closed -->

- [ ] I verified that this is not a filter issue
    - Filter issues MUST be reported at [filter issue tracker](https://github.com/uBlockOrigin/uAssets/issues)
    <!--
        - If disabling uBO <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Quick-guide:-popup-user-interface#the-large-power-button> makes the issue go away, then in all likelihood this is a filter issue.
        - See what the logger <https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/The-logger> reports when you reproduce the issue, this will help you determine whether this is a filter issue.
    -->
- [ ] This is not a support issue or a question
    - Support issues and questions are handled at [/r/uBlockOrigin](https://old.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/)
    <!-- Such issue will be closed as invalid -->
- [ ] I performed a cursory search of the issue tracker to avoid opening a duplicate issue
    - Your issue may already be reported
- [ ] The issue is not present after wholly disabling uBlock Origin ("uBO") in the browser
    - If the issue is still present after wholly disabling uBO in the browser, then the issue is unrelated to uBO
- I tried to reproduce the issue when...
    - [ ] uBO is the only extension
    - [ ] uBO with default lists/settings
    - [ ] using a new, unmodified browser profile
- [ ] I checked the [documentation](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki) to understand that the issue I report is not a normal behavior
